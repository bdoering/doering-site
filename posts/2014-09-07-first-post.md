## Running is Fun

I like going running regularly. It's a fun sport that takes off my
mind, and often takes me a little into nature. I both enjoy running by
myself or with friends. It's a different but always nice experience.
Basically I like how simple it all is. I just need some shoes and a
bit of free time, and I can basically do it anywhere, anytime.

## Barefoot Running is More Fun

It's now more than a year ago that I started to gradually change my
running style. I didn't have any problems or so. I guess I was mostly
wondering how a change would feel, and if it's a better style for me
or not. Also, I like trying out new things, just for the sake of it.

My old running style is the one that most people have adopted: The
*[heel strike](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPP7jFiTocQ)*. Basically,
running is a succession of small jumps, and for the heel strike
technique, the first part hitting the ground is, well, the heel. The
heel actually hits the ground slightly in front of the body's center
of mass. This results in a sudden impact for the body because the
center of mass needs to get over the pivot point defined by the
foot. The strong impact is a reason why most running shoes have a
dampening sole which is especially thick at the heel. Many people
including myself try to dampen the impact even further by allowing for
a bend in the hip, from which you need to recover at the next step. A
bend in the hip is a sure way to lose energy and speed, and certainly
one of the first points a running training will point out for
correction...

So for a bit more than a year now I am training the *forefoot* and
*[mid-foot strike](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=humkZAtZVW0)*. The
difference between the two is rather small for me, in comparison to
moving away from the totally different heel strike. With the forefoot
and mid-foot strike, the foot lands differently. As the names say,
it's not the heel that strikes the ground first. The foot also doesn't
touch the ground in front of the body, but rather just below it, which
helps the constant falling-forward movement. I really like the
side-effects: My torso and my head are much more stable, and the style
just feels more efficient. If it really is, I don't know (a timed run
is still on my to-do list), but its fun.

Also, the forefoot strike is the natural way of running when you are
barefoot. And barefoot running can be rewarding in and off itself, as
I discovered again today on my little jogging round!

These are the *little* things that make me happy. This moment of
floating above the grass at dusk, for a little moment believing that
my legs have nothing much to do with my head, and yet being one.


## So What Does This Have to do With Blogging?

This blog is my idea to carry the same experience of "enjoyable
floating" over to writing: To detach the mechanics of my fingers from
my brain, to decouple the effort from the enjoyment. I want to try to
wholly enjoy being in the moment of writing, feeling light-headed,
without constraints.

This blog shall be my private patch of wet grass where I can practice
and enjoy writing, to get better over time without feeling
pressured. And why not? This has already worked with jogging before.
