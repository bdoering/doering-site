00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
A SAR system (satellite) illuminates a scene and passes over an ideal point target, a metallic sphere (reddish color).

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.500
The SAR instrument emits frequency modulated pulses (chirps) and records them again after reception.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The reddish rectangular signal in range direction signifies the envelope of the received pulses (<i>ideal</i> target = flat frequency response = rectangular shape).

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The <i>ideal</i> target has no angular dependence. Therefore the chirp envelope in azimuth is also flat.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Now the raw data is processed in range direction with an <i>ideal</i> replica (rectangular envelope).

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.500
Analogously, the data is processed in azimuth, again with an <i>ideal</i> replica.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.000
The result is interpreted as a gray-scale image.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.800
The actual point target energy (the measurement result of the radiometric measurement) ...

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
is the integral over the pixel intensities within the cross area.


00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
We now replace the ideal radar target with a real-world target (here: a corner reflector, a typical calibration target).

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:41.000
The RCS of the corner reflector at the center frequency is identical to the RCS of the sphere from before.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:55.000
The frequency-dependent RCS of the real-world target produces recorded
chirps with a deformed (not rectangular) envelope.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.800
The received pulses are also weighted in azimuth due to the angular-dependent RCS of the target.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:12.000
Now the raw data is processed again with ideal (flat) chirps.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The measurement result is different, although the reference RCSs of the sphere and the corner reflector are identical.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.500
Same real-world target as before, but now the raw data is processed ...

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:44.000
with weighted range and azimuth chirps (improved side-lobe suppression).

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The range and azimuth weighting is typically SAR system and mode dependent.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
After compression, the impulse response has been shaped indistinguishably both by the target and the processor.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
The radiometric measurement result is consequentely affected. 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
This has been ignored so far, leading to radiometric measurement errors (ranging from negligible to several decibels)...

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.400
when results of different systems are compared.
