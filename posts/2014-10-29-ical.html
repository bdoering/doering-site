<p>Calibration is the topic I have been working on for the last few years. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_aperture_radar">synthetic aperture radar</a> (SAR), one of the calibration tasks is <em>radiometric calibration</em>, which ensures that gray scale values in <a href="http://www.dlr.de/eo/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-6695/10983_read-10126/gallery-1/gallery_read-Image.1.3751/">SAR</a> <a href="http://www.dlr.de/eo/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-6695/10983_read-10126/gallery-1/gallery_read-Image.1.3770/">images</a> are comparable and compatible across image acquisitions and missions.</p>
<p>A good calibration requires one to be accurate, both in measurements and in terminology. This post is about the second, specifically about the (from my point of view wrong) usage of <em>internal calibration</em> in <abbr title="synthetic aperture radar">SAR</abbr>.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Go to the <a href="#conclusions">wrap up</a> if you just want to know my suggestion of how to improve used terminology.</p>
<h2 id="the-background-what-actually-is-calibration">The Background: What Actually is Calibration?</h2>
<p>Let’s turn to definitions. Maybe the best known technical standard in the world of metrology is the <a href="http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/guides/gum.html"><em>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</em></a> (GUM), which is the only internationally accepted standard on measurement uncertainties. In the accompanying <a href="http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/guides/#vim"><em>International Vocabulary of Metrology</em></a> (VIM), calibration is defined as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>operation that, under specified conditions, in a first step, establishes a relation between the quantity values with measurement uncertainties provided by measurement standards and corresponding indications with associated measurement uncertainties and, in a second step, uses this information to establish a relation for obtaining a measurement result from an indication</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The definition of calibration might be a bit wordy, but it stresses the importance of a measurement standard, a reference with which the calibration is conducted.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-internal-and-external-calibration-in-synthetic-aperture-radar">The Problem: Internal and External Calibration in Synthetic Aperture Radar</h2>
<p>So how are the terms <em>internal</em> and <em>external</em> calibration currently used in <abbr title="synthetic aperture radar">SAR</abbr>?</p>
<dl>
<dt>Internal Calibration (ICAL)</dt>
<dd><p>Internal calibration refers to the process of estimating and correcting for amplitude and phase drifts of the <abbr title="synthetic aperture radar">SAR</abbr> instrument. The drifts are mostly caused by temperature changes, but component aging or mechanical movement (e. g. of cables) are other further causes.</p>
<p>The process of internal calibration is specific to a single <abbr title="synthetic aperture radar">SAR</abbr> instrument. Internal calibration results (i. e., corrections) are never carried over to another <abbr title="synthetic aperture radar">SAR</abbr> instrument.</p>
</dd>
<dt>External Calibration (ECAL)</dt>
<dd><p>For external calibration, (calibrated) measurement standards like corner reflectors or transponders are distributed and aligned on ground. After image acquisition by a <abbr title="synthetic aperture radar">SAR</abbr> instrument, the responses of the known radar targets are used to estimate <abbr title="synthetic aperture radar">SAR</abbr> system calibration factors (most notably the radiometric calibration constant).</p>
<p>After external calibration, metrological traceability is established; measurement results from different <abbr title="synthetic aperture radar">SAR</abbr> instruments become comparable.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The problem is that the term <em>internal calibration</em> is used for a procedure which does not comprise any calibration standard. No calibration is actually happening. In contrast, the term <em>external calibration</em> describes an actual calibration in accordance with the GUM definition given above.</p>
<p>By the way: A transponder is an active device (it has an amplifier loop) and, like a <abbr title="synthetic aperture radar">SAR</abbr> instrument, it suffers from gain and phase drifts due to temperature changes or component aging. It also requires what is currently called an <em>internal calibration loop</em> to monitor and correct these drifts. So whenever I talk about <em>internal calibration</em> in this post, I mean the internal calibration of <abbr title="synthetic aperture radar">SAR</abbr> satellites and <abbr title="synthetic aperture radar">SAR</abbr> calibration transponders alike.</p>
<h2 id="the-resolution-alternative-terminology">The Resolution: Alternative Terminology</h2>
<p>What is currently known as <em>internal calibration</em> is a correction for a systematic effect (temperature drift or component aging). The VIM defines correction as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>compensation for an estimated systematic effect</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly what is going on in a <abbr title="synthetic aperture radar">SAR</abbr> instrument or a transponder: A systematic effect is estimated by routing signals with a known amplitude through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency">RF</a> loop. Subsequent analysis reveals by how much the amplitude or phase has drifted in comparison to an earlier measurement. The estimated drift is then either compensated directly (in the case of a transponder) or during later data processing (for <abbr title="synthetic aperture radar">SAR</abbr> satellites, where drifts are currently only corrected on-ground after the data has been downloaded).</p>
<p>Consequently, what we currently call <em>internal calibration</em> should actually be called <strong>(internal) drift correction</strong> and the <em>internal calibration loop</em> should rather be called <strong>(internal) drift correction loop</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="when-is-the-terminology-internal-calibration-appropriate">When is the Terminology <em>Internal Calibration</em> Appropriate?</h2>
<p>Some measurement instruments (other than <abbr title="synthetic aperture radar">SAR</abbr> instruments or calibration transponders) actually have a measurement standard built in. The process of internal calibration then refers to measuring this internal standard in an automated fashion in order to update the relationship between a quantity value of a measurement standard and a measurement result.</p>
<p>An examples of such a measurement instrument is a precision weighing scale like the <a href="http://www.aandd.jp/products/weighing/balance/industrial/gp.html">GP-20K</a> built by A&amp;D Weighing. An internal measurement standard and a motor allow automatized calibrations.</p>
<p>For <abbr title="synthetic aperture radar">SAR</abbr>, including an internal measurement standard is not an option. The quantity that needs to be measured is by necessity in the far field of the instrument and therefore cannot be internal to it.</p>
<p>Practically speaking though, the terms <em>internal</em> and <em>external calibration</em> are used similarly for scales and <abbr title="synthetic aperture radar">SAR</abbr> instruments: In both domains is internal calibration used frequently and external calibration only periodically to ensure compatible measurement results with low measurement uncertainties.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Wrap up: Recommended Terminology</h2>
<p>In the context of synthetic aperture radar:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>All calibration (radiometric and geometric) is by necessity <em>external</em>. So <em>external calibration</em> (ECAL) should simply be called <em>calibration</em>. (Also, every calibration is always <em>absolute</em>, so let’s not use the term <em>absolute calibration</em> either.)</li>
<li><em>Internal calibration</em> (ICAL) is a misnomer. Calibration always requires a measurement standard, but no measurement standards are included in what is called <em>internal calibration</em> in <abbr title="synthetic aperture radar">SAR</abbr> today. A possible alternative term: <em>(internal) drift correction</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Adopting an accurate terminology avoids confusions and ensures compatibility with other fields of metrology. From experience, it certainly helps in not misleading students which are new to the field of <abbr title="synthetic aperture radar">SAR</abbr> calibration.</p>
