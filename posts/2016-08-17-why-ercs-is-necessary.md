Background
----------

As part of my thesis on traceable radiometric calibration of synthetic aperture radars (SARs), I proposed the novel radiometric measurement quantity *equivalent radar cross section* (ERCS) to address some fundamental problems with the currently used definition *radar cross section* (RCS). The purpose of the new definition is to facilitate radiometric measurements which are truly comparable across missions, and where the measurement results can become metrologically [traceable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceability#Measurement).

A definition by itself is of little use if it is not adopted by a significantly large group. Hence the proposed %ERCS definition is one of the topics to be discussed at the coming [workshop](http://sarcv.ceos.org/workshop2016) of the [SAR subgroup](http://sarcv.ceos.org/) of the [CEOS](http://ceos.org/) [Working Group on Calibration and Validation](http://ceos.org/ourwork/workinggroups/wgcv/), where recommendations for the larger %SAR community may be formulated. The discussion has been started as a [Loomio thread](https://www.loomio.org/d/QPIwuD4R/adopting-equivalent-radar-cross-section-ercs-as-the-radiometric-measurement-quantity-for-sar-images).

The [Loomio thread](https://www.loomio.org/d/QPIwuD4R/adopting-equivalent-radar-cross-section-ercs-as-the-radiometric-measurement-quantity-for-sar-images) gives a summary of what is proposed and what the benefits of adopting %ERCS are (see the [references](#references) for details). The purpose of this post is to add an introductory video on why the shift from %RCS to %ERCS should be strongly considered.

Note that the video only captures part of the reasoning. It captures the part though which is easier explained by images than by words.
